# Product Overview

AI-optimized React starter template for building type-safe, feature-driven web applications.

## Core Philosophy

- **Type-Driven Development**: Define Zod schemas first, then generate UI
- **Colocation**: Keep related code (API, types, components, routes) together by feature
- **Fail Fast**: Runtime validation with Zod catches API contract changes immediately
- **AI-First**: Optimized for AI-assisted development with strict typing and conventions

## Key Capabilities

- Full-stack type safety from API to UI
- File-based routing with type-safe parameters
- Mock API development with MSW
- Feature-based architecture for scalable codebases
- Accessible UI components (Radix UI + Tailwind)
